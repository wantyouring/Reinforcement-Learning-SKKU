    Winter is here. You and your friends were tossing around a frisbee at the park
    when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of the lake.
    The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the ice has melted.
    If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the freezing water.
    The surface is described using a grid like the following

        SFFF
        FHFH
        FFFH
        HFFG

    S : starting point, safe
    F : frozen surface, safe
    H : hole, fall to your doom
    G : goal, where the frisbee is located
    The episode ends when you reach the goal or fall in a hole.
    You receive a reward of 1 if you reach the goal, and zero otherwise.
